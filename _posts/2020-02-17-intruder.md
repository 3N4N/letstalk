As he would do every other night, Atiq returned home from his tuition.
He had gotten dinner at the hotel downstairs. It was not healthy——what
they served——but he wasn’t health conscious either.

He brushed his teeth, turned off the light, plugged off his phone and
went to bed. After watching funny online videos for an hour or three, he
slipped into sleep.

He woke up with his body paralyzed, not being able to move even his
muscle.

The doctors called it narcolepsy. He had been experiencing these
episodes since his college years. His doctors decided it was due to,
apparently, irregular sleep cycle and psychological stress. They assured
him it was nothing to be afraid of and was quite common. For all their
words, Atiq had a feeling none of them had narcolepsy themselves. It was
definitely something to be afraid of.

Caw! CAW!

He glanced at the window to his right, since he could not move his head.
There was a crow perched on the windowsill, preening its feathers and
cocking its head. It stared at Atiq as if waiting for his response. When
it didn’t get any, it beat its wings and cawed once more, harsher than
before as if to display its urgency.

The moonlight seeped through the window like molten silver, creating an
eerie aura. The crow took flight, showering Atiq with a dreadful stench
of moist earth, mold and all things dead, and perched on his chest.
Cocking its head to one side, it cawed in Atiq’s face. The stink of
death was overwhelming, almost gagging. Atiq couldn’t move yet. And now
his lungs refused to breath in such foul air. Panicking, he started to
shudder, willing his body to snap out of the episode.

The crow hopped onto his face from his chest, its sharp nails and callus
feet digging into his skin with peculiar discomfort. It cawed once more,
now close enough for Atiq to see every barb of its dark, ominous
feather. The underbelly of the crow had gray spots on it, and was damp
and soggy as the body of a rotting corpse.

He felt his heart pumping hot blood through his vein, his body clammy
and dank with sweat. The crow, big as Atiq’s face, started pecking at
his face. At his lips, splitting it apart for Atiq to taste his blood.
At his nose, cutting it open for Atiq to inhale his blood. At his eye,
gouging it out with a soggy squeak.

Atiq sat bolt upright, screaming and holding his eye with his hand. The
eye that was not there anymore.

A second later, Atiq stopped screaming. Panting and sweating, he moved
his hand around to feel his eye. *It’s still there!* He looked around
for the crow but found no trace of it.

*Just a dream. Sheesh!*

He turned around and patted his pillow to get ready to go to sleep
again.

A single dark feather floated up from the pillow and, swinging left and
right, settled down on it again.
